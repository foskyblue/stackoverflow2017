## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What is the average salary of web developers and which group has the highest average job satisfaction?
2. What is the most adopted methodology and version control in software development?
3. How important is the knowledge of algorithms and data structures, and communication skills in the recruitment of Software developers? 



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This project contains 3 notebooks used to showcase the work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. Docstrings are also used to document functions.  

Also, there is an additional Utils.py file that contains some special functions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
